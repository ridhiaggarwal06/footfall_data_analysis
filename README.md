#### Project Summary
A data analytics and statistical modelling project analysing pedestrian footfall in York city centre to support location optimisation for a promotional stall. Using R, tidyverse, data visualisation, and hypothesis testing, I compared Coney Street vs Stonegate to deliver a data-driven business recommendation.

#### Business Problem
A promoter needed to identify the highest-traffic retail location to maximise visibility and potential revenue. The objective was to:
* Compare average daily footfall
* Test for statistical significance
* Provide weekday vs weekend recommendations

#### Data
* Dataset: York pedestrian footfall camera data
* Period Analysed: 2019 (pre-COVID baseline)
* Metrics: Daily footfall by location
* Data Preparation: Integrity checks, filtering, feature creation (weekend flag)

#### Tools & Technical Skills
* Libraries: tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2
* Analytics Techniques:
  - Data cleaning & validation
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Data visualisation
  - Two-sample t-tests
  - Statistical inference
  - Business insight translation

#### Methodology

* Verified data quality and consistency
* Generated summary statistics (mean, SD, min, max)
* Built distribution plots to compare traffic patterns
* Conducted hypothesis testing for:
  - All days
  - Weekends only
* Converted statistical outputs into commercial insights

#### Key Insights
* Coney Street recorded significantly higher mean footfall than Stonegate.
* The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
* Weekend traffic advantage was even stronger for Coney Street.
* Footfall variability indicates higher exposure potential and peak activity on Coney Street.

#### Business Recommendation
* Primary location: Coney Street
* Weekend promotions: Strongly favour Coney Street

This recommendation is supported by quantitative analysis and inferential statistics, enabling evidence-based decision-making.
